The first result regarding the advice complexity of DPA has been published
in \cite{komm-thesis} and it states that the minimum amount of advice
required to achieve optimality is $(L-1)/2$ bits. This bound has since
been improved in \cite{sofsem2014} to $L-1$ bits. \todo{Give a brief
overview of the proof.} The same paper also
details an optimal algorithm using the same amount of advice, which we
reproduce below, since multiple competitive algorithms discussed later on
are modified versions of this particular optimal algorithm.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{sofsem2014}]\label{theorem:dpa-optimal}
    There is an online algorithm which guarantees an optimal solution
    using $L-1$ bits of advice.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The algorithm $A$ works as follows. After obtaining the length $L$,
    $A$ reads $L-1$ bits from the advice string with the following
    meaning: the $i$-th bit (denoted by $b_i$, for $i \in \{1, \dots,
    L-1\}$ indicates whether $A$ should accept a request starting in
    vertex $v_i$. We always set $b_0$ to $1$.

    Then, whenever $A$ processes a request $(i, j)$ that does not conflict
    with any already admitted request, $A$ accepts it iff $b_i = 1$ and
    $b_k = 0$ for all $i < k < j$.
\end{proof}
