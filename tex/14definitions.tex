Having described the basic concepts in informal terms, let us now proceed
to formally define the model we are working with.

\begin{definition}[Online Algorithm]\label{def:online-algorithm}
    Let $I = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ be an input sequence of an online problem.
    An \emph{online algorithm} $A$ computes the output sequence $A(I) =
    (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ such that $y_i = f(x_1, \dots, x_i)$ for some
    function $f$. We denote the cost of the solution computed by $A$ as
    $C(A(I))$.
\end{definition}

An optimal solution for $I$ will be denoted by $Opt(I)$. By optimal
solution we mean one which can be computed by an offline algorithm with
unbounded computational power, such that, in the case of maximization
problems, it maximizes the cost. We will use $E[X]$ to denote the expected
value of a random variable $X$.

\begin{definition}[Competitive Ratio]\label{def:competitive-ratio}
    Consider an optimization problem in which the goal is to maximize the
    cost of a solution. An algorithm $A$ is $c$-competitive if there is a
    constant $\alpha$ such that for each instance $I$ we have $C(A(I))
    \geq C(Opt(I)) / c - \alpha$. If $\alpha = 0$, we say that $A$ is
    strictly $c$-competitive. The \emph{competitive ratio} of $A$ is the
    smallest $c$ such that $A$ is $c$-competitive.
\end{definition}

For minimization problems, competitiveness is defined analogously, only
the inequality changes to $C(A(I)) \leq c \cdot C(Opt(I)) + \alpha$.

The previous definition can easily be extended to randomized algorithms.
For each instance $I$ we require $E[C(A(I))] \geq C(Opt(I)) / c -
\alpha$. We say that the expected competitive ratio of $A$ is the smallest
value of $c$ satisfying the above inequality.

We shall now extend the above definitions to include advice.

\begin{definition}[Online Algorithm with Advice]\label{def:online-advice}
    Consider an input sequence $I = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ and an infinite
    binary string $\phi$.  An \emph{online algorithm $A$ with advice}
    computes the sequence $A^\phi(I) = (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ if $y_i =
    f(\phi, x_1, \dots, x_i)$. We call $\phi$ the \emph{advice string}.
\end{definition}

As stated earlier, the computation of $A$ can be interpreted as a series
of turns, where in the $i$-th turn the algorithm reads $x_i$ and yields
$y_i$ using all the information read so far and possibly some additional
bits from the advice string $\phi$. It is worth noting that the definition
does not restrict the computational power of $A$.

\begin{definition}[Advice Complexity]\label{def:advice-complexity}
    The \emph{advice complexity} of an algorithm $A$ is a function $s$
    such that $s(n)$ is the smallest value such that for each input
    sequence of size $n$ there is an advice string $\phi$ such that the
    algorithm $A$ examines at most the first $s(n)$ bits of $\phi$. The
    advice complexity of an online problem is the smallest advice
    complexity of an online algorithm which computes an optimal solution
    for each instance.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:advice-competitive}
    An online algorithm with advice $A$ is $c$-competitive if there is a
    constant $\alpha$ such that for every $n \in \N$ and for every
    instance $I$ of size at most $n$ there is an advice string $\phi$ for
    which $C(A^\phi(I)) \geq C(Opt(I)) / c - \alpha$ holds.
\end{definition}

Throughout this thesis we use $\log x$ to denote the binary logarithm of
$x$.
